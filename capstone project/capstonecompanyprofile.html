    <h2>about us</h2>
    <br/>
<h3>mission statement</h3> <p>Our mission statement is to provide a factory like expirence to anyone looking to purchase nike wrestling shoes.</P>
<br/>
<h3>company history</h3> <p>Our company was born out of neccesity. Nike wrestling shoes are beloved by wrestlers everywear (just attend any tournament), but nike doesnt sell any wrestling shoes direct to consumer. So our goal as a company is to offer as close to a factory expirence as possible for nike wrestling gear. 
</br>
<h3>Administration</h3> <p> Our administatrition is just me for now, but we hope to expand in the near future.</p>
<br/>
<h3>Community involvement</h3> <p> As a company we really value serving the underprivlaged. To do this we focus on a rescource we have... wrestling shoes. For every 10 pairs of shoes sold our company donates a pair to a local wrestling team.
